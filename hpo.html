        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to prepare the next generation of healthcare leaders by equipping students with the ability to critically
          engage with new discoveries, communicate research through clear and professional writing, and advocate for evidence-driven progress.
          The HPO Initiative Chapter at Texas A&amp;M offers undergraduates an early platform for professional scholarship—transforming academic
          curiosity into credible contributions and building the foundation for future publication in official journals and leadership
          in shaping the direction of medicine.

          platform for outcomes such as journal-ready articles, conference presentations, and informed public health/policy advocacy.
