        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to divert organic waste from landfills through convenient collection, education,
          and data-driven partnerships—transforming scraps into soil, reducing greenhouse gases, and empowering
          students to lead lasting environmental and public-health solutions.

        <h2>Why Compostify</h2>
        <p>
          Compostify exists to close the loop on campus by capturing food and yard waste, composting it responsibly,
          and returning nutrients to local soils. We educate, measure impact, and collaborate with dining, facilities,
          and student groups to reduce methane emissions, improve air quality, and build a healthier, more resilient community.

        <h2>Why Start a Campus Chapter</h2>
        <p>
          Waste isn’t just an environmental issue—it’s a public health issue. Landfill-bound food waste drives methane emissions,
          worsens air quality, attracts pests, and squanders nutrients that could rebuild soils and local food systems.
          The goal is to work with Dining, Facilities, and student orgs to pilot collection at high-waste sites,
          run contamination-reduction education, and track impact (lbs diverted, methane avoided, soil returned to campus gardens).
          Beyond bins, the chapter builds composting habits through peer education, residence hall challenges, and service events that
          connect climate action to respiratory health, heat resilience, and food security.

        <h2>Plan of Action</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with park cleanups (Aggie Park → Lake Bryan, and throughout the community).</li>
          <li>Place compost bins inside all dining halls and the MSC.</li>
          <li>Host guest speakers from the EPA and the School of Public Health.</li>
          <li>Expand into communities and other large gathering areas (parks around Bryan/College Station).</li>
          <li>Provide awareness regarding this major public health issue.</li>
